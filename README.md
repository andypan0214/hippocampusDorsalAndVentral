# hippocampusDorsalAndVentral
This project has successfully achieved the separation of the dorsal and ventral parts of the subregion from the hippocampus,
specifically CA1, CA3, DG, and Suniculumn. Additionally, the project has developed a Rshiny Application,
enabling my co-workers to conveniently examine candidate genes for further experiment design.
